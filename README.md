# HyHooVer
new method for model-free verification of a general class of control
system with unknown nonlinear hybrid dynamics, where the state-space has both a continuum and a discrete
component. Specifically, we focus on finding what choices of initial states or parameters maximize a given
probabilistic objective function over all choices of initial states or parameters from such hybrid state-space,
without having exact knowledge of the system dynamics.
